# Divshot Pitch Deck

Created using [Impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js), to run it you will need to clone it and open `index.html` in your browser.

## Editing

Edit `index.html` to add content and edit `sass/presentation.sass` to edit styles. You will need to be running Guard with compass to get the SASS to compile:

```sh
gem install guard guard-compass compass
guard
```

## Outline

Hi, we're Divshot, and with your help we're going to change the way web applications are built.

* Problem: Mockup tools create throwaway images. Drag and drop editors create garbage markup.
* Solution: Divshot is an interface builder for the web that focuses on user experience and clean, usable output.
* Why Now: Modern browser tech allows for fast, intuitive interfaces like never before. Community efforts like Twitter Bootstrap give the web a common language of interface components. Divshot marries these together.
